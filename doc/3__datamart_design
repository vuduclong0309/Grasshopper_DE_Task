# Grasshopper Data Engineering Case Study
## DataMart Logical Design

In this section we will provide insight on how to generate a data warehouse to solve this problem efficiently

## DataMart Characteristic
- Data Warehouse Style: Kimball model (Bottom up), star schema
  - Business process oriented
  - Fast designing
  - Data is not complexed yet (though can be prone to extension in future)
    - Nonetheless, type of order tend to be slow changing.

Note*
- Top-down Inmon might be preferred if there is more time:
  - Effort for implementing requirement changes is lower
  - Benefits in term of future maintainance cost

- Update style: Minutes batches (as per design), easy extensible for unifying with a real time application

- Architecture: component of Lambda architecture (Batch layer)
